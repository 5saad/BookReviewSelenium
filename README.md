# BookReviewSelenium
This is my Selenium testing for my Book Reviews project.

To use:
1) Make sure the project is up and running
2) In this project, go to src/test/java/pages
3) In these classes, if needed, change the url to the front-end live html URL
4) go to src/test/java/Booktest or src/test/java/Reviewtest
5) Now you can test all of the functions by running the classes as JUNIT Test
